title: New Tools for my Blog
author: Vanni Totaro
---

I like **clean code**, **full control** and **modern tools**.

This is why I switched my blog from [Blogger](http://blogger.com)
to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), opening the door to these great tools:
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog-aware, static site generator;
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers;
- [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers), a safe template language for flexible web apps;
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), a toolkit to kickstart development of webapps and sites;
- [Disqus](http://disqus.com), a global comment system that improves discussion on websites.

It's so easy and enjoyable to use them together!

If you're curious about it take a look at my [blog source code repository](https://github.com/vannitotaro/vannitotaro.github.com) on GitHub.
